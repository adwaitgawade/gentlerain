# IDE used
### Antigravity
I used antigravity to create this website but it didn't work out mostly. \
It was good in the beginning but then it started to get too bad. \
If I implement one animation antigravity removes the other. \
Doesn't understand the context well even if I provide browseruse or screenshots.

### Cursor
Then I used cursor, not for prompting or code generation but for it's CSS inspector. \
I was able to understand the properties implemented on the dom elements very well thanks to it.

# Assets
I used the assets from the original website. \
To identify colors I used the inspect tool of the browser and also the color meter app provided my macos.

# LLMs used
I used ChatGPT, Claude and Grok to generate code all 3 because why not. \
I tested the output from all 3 providers and used the one that works best.


# Conclusion
Overall I would say the LLMs and IDE were sort of helpful for creating these complex animations, but the GSAP community blogs and other libraries were the real MVP.
